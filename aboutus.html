    <h1>More About Me Page</h1>
    <p>My name is Axel and as mentioned before, I am a student at Correlation 1 studying frontend Web Development.</p>
    <p>So far I have learned about HTML and CSS. I have used Codio, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub in my journey so far. I have completed almost 50% of the program and I am excited to see where it leads.<br>
    I am working on side projocts that include mock websites to practice and show in my portfolio. I will be updating this site with projects as I complete them.</p>
